# Budget-Tracker-App
App coded in RShiny that reads in excel data about my spending, and generates an interactive report that helps me analyze and track my spending. The app also allows you to input new purchased items and save them to the existing excel file. The code only tracks expenses, and not things you earned. It is customizable to have any spending categories the user thinks is important to them.

Initial incentive: I did not like the budgeting apps I found on the market, and I did not want to spend money on one that is not completly customizable to my needs, and where I would still have to put in a lot of effort to make it work. Since I needed to put in the effort, I decided to go all in and code an app for myself that tells me what I want to know.

'Budget Tracker app' is the RShiny code file. Note that there are some fine details that need tunning and things I want to add, but otherwise it is very functional.

'Budget - record template' excel file has the headers that the R file reads in, so that the code can run. Actual data is excluded, since I use data from my personal spending.
